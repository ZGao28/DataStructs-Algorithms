/* 

ES6, or EMCAScript6, is a (somewhat recent) huge update on the Javascript language. 
This new standard provides plenty of powerful and useful features, but also depricates some old ones.
Proficiency in the new ES6 features is a must for any JS developers, whether it be for front end or back end.
Below are some of the more important ES6 features, along with examples.
For a full list on all the changes, visit this page: http://es6-features.org/#Constants

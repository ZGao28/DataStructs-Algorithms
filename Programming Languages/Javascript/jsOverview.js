/*

Javascript is a powerful, function forward scripting language. 

Thanks to the numerous frameworks developed to support Javascript, 
this popular programming language can be used to create a wide variety of things.

There is React, Angular, Vue, jQuery, and many others for front end web developement.
There is Node, Express, Meteor, Feather and many others for back end web development.
There is even React Native for native app development.

While it's not perfect, Javascript is still a language that I would recommend to all programmers. 
This is in no way a complete guide to the Javascript language, but there will be some important JS features and examples below.

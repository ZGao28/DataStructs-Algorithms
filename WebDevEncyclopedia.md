# Web Development Encyclopedia
A terminology document with anything related to web development, whether it be frontend or backend. Refer to this when engaging in intellectual conversations with other techies (to flex your knowledge :P).  

### CORS
Stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. By adding additional information in the HTTP request header, it allows one domain to request resources from another domain.

**E.G.** http://domainA.com/ makes a call to an api at http://api.domainB.com/someApi

### Regex
Stands for regular expression. It is a special text string that specifies a pattern to search for in another string or document.

**E.G.** To find all valid email addresses in a document could use the regular expression \b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]
{2,6}\b

### API
Stands for Application Programming Interface. Probably one of the most used terms in all of web development. An API is just a mechanism (function) that allows two programs to communicate and share information.

**E.g.** My program will use the Facebook friends list API to get a list of friends.

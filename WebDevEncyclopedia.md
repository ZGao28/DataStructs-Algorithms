# Web Development Encyclopedia
A terminology document with anything related to web development, whether it be frontend or backend. Refer to this when engaging in intellectual conversations with other techies (to flex your knowledge :P).  

## A -

### API
Stands for Application Programming Interface. Probably one of the most used terms in all of web development. An API is just a mechanism (function) that allows two programs to communicate and share information.

**E.g.** My program will use the Facebook friends list API to get a list of friends.

### Camelcasing
Naming convention in which all spaces are removed and the next term's first letter is capitalized. Standard naming convention used by languages like Javascript.

**E.G.** someVariableName, or dogOne

### CORS
Stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. By adding additional information in the HTTP request header, it allows one domain to request resources from another domain.

**E.G.** http://domainA.com/ makes a call to an api at http://api.domainB.com/someApi

### Cache
A cache, or caching layer, is a storage system to provide snappier request completion and reduce stress on your servers. When a new resource is requested for the first time, it can be stored in a cache, and future requests for that resource will be sent from the cache instead of having to query everything through your backend all over again. Caches usually are pretty small in storage size and should not be used to store rapidly changing data - because then the users will be getting stale data!

**E.g.** Facebook caches some of your old photos so that loading them is much faster.

### Lazy Loading
Lazy loading is a general concept in programming in which assets are loaded only when they're needed. For example, if you have a lot of large, high definition images, it would take a lot of extra time loading them in. It's hugely inefficient and unneccesary if they won't even be rendered right away. The simple usage of lazy loading can decrease website load times several times over.

**E.g.** Facebook lazy loads posts that are less relevant - they only load when you scroll down to them.

### Regex
Stands for regular expression. It is a special text string that specifies a pattern to search for in another string or document.

**E.G.** To find all valid email addresses in a document could use the regular expression \b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]
{2,6}\b

### Responsive Design
A general desgin term. Basically it just means designs that can scale up or down to look good on any device resolution.

**E.G.** Facebook's webapp looks good on mobile and on a large monitor, because it has a expertly made responsive design. 

## S -

### Snakecase
A naming style in which spaces are replaced with underscores. This is the standard naming convention for SQL tables and columns.

**E.G.** some_variable_name, or dog_one

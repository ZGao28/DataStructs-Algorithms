# List of Useful Data Structures

#### Arrays:
- Basically all data structures are eventually stored as array
- Most efficient lookup speed, efficient storage
- Used for all kinds of problems, basic and complex
- Inefficient search O(n)

#### Linked Lists:
- Useful for representing sequential access, and O(1) insertion
- Flexible information storage, does not have to be strictly typed
- Extra use of space due to pointers stored and O(n) search time

#### Stacks:
- Various real life representations for first in last out
- Used in a bunch of graph and tree traversal algorithms
- Fast insertion and removal of top item
- Extra use of space due to pointers, O(n) search time

#### Queues:
- Various real life representations for first in first out
- Used in a bunch of graph and tree traversal algorithms
- Fast insertion and removal of last item
- Extra use of space due to pointers, O(n) search time

#### Binary Trees / N-ary Trees:
- Allows for very fast search
- Has relationships that model real life relationships (e.g. parent and child nodes)
- Storage can be in an array to save space

#### Tries
- Lots of practical usages, such as autocomplete, genome analysis, data analytics 

#### Disjoint Sets
- Super fast lookup time for group it belongs in
- Real life applications such as finding minimum spanning trees, connectivity between nodes

#### Graphs
- Perhaps the data structure that has the most number of real life applications
- Variety of efficient algorithms to store and process data using graphs

#### Hash Structures
- Super useful mainly for efficient look up, O(1), and establishing relationships between variables
- Hash functions can be cool

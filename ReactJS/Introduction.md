# Introduction - What is ReactJS and Why Use it?

ReactJS, usually just referred to as 'React', is a front-end framework mainly used for making webapp user interfaces, created by developers at Facebook. There are many different front end frameworks out there (Angular, Vue), but React is one of the most popular. Why is that? 

Here are some reasons:

    1. It is lightweight. It isn't overloaded with different functionalities, but still has powerful tools to do whats needed.

    2. It is fast. React has a special way of updating front end interfaces that makes it much faster to relay changes in the state of the views.

    3. It is scalable. React is modular, meaning it is easy to break down large pages into small components and reuse them if necessary. 

    4. It has lots of support, due to it's popularity, so problems you come into are more easily solved.


If you're looking to get into web development, whether it's front end, back end, fullstack, or UI design, ReactJS is a very handy framework to learn. It is relatively easy to get started with, the only pre-requisite needed is some familiarity with Javascript (especially ES6 features). And while not necessary, it is also very helpful to have prior experience with HTML, CSS, and other more general web development concepts (E.G AJAX, REST).

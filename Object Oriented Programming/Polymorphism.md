# Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the last pillar of OOP, and is often the one that seems the most confusing. It's really not as scary as people think. Polymorphism as the name suggests, simply refers to the ability to change/have multiple definitions of a function with the same name.

There are two main types of polymorphism - overriding a parent classes method, and overloading a method. 

Overloading just means creating two functions with the same name with different function parameters. This is super useful, as there are many tasks that can perform multiple different things based on what the input is.

Overriding a parent class can be seen as lets say the parent class has a certain method to perform a certain action, but the child class is also able to perform the action but just in a slightly different way. In that case you can override the parent's method with the child method named the same way.

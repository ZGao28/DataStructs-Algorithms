# Object Oriented Programming

**Object oriented programming** (**OOP** for short) is a very popular **programming language paradigm**. Programming language paradigms are ways to classify the behaviours of a programming language. A singular language can have multiple paradigms, but most of the super popular languages support the OOP paradigm, because of how clean and robust it is. It's something that just *makes sense*.

Java, Python, C++, Ruby, C#, are all examples of heavily used languages that are classified under the OOP paradigm. Even JavaScript can be considered part of the family, although it doesn't do **class based** OOP like the aforementioned languages. We'll cover that later on. 

Knowledge of OOP is very important, and is required for the majority of programming jobs.

## Overview

To properly explain all the concepts of OOP would take quite a long time, as it is one of the broadest and most well studied areas of computer science and software engineering. Instead I will do brief explainations on the important stuff - **the 4 Pillars of OOP**.

Those are:

##### 1. Encapsulation
##### 2. Abstraction
##### 3. Inheritance
##### 4. Polymorphism

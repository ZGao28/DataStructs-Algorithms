# Inheritance

Ok now we have gotten to a very unique part of Object Oriented Programming. The third of the four main principles of OOP, **inheritance** just means the ability to pass down traits for a child to **inherit** from it's parent(s). 

Think back to the Car class example from the previous two pages. The Car can be considered a child class. A suitable parent class could be named *Automobile*. All automobiles have traits such as engines. All automobiles have the ability to move. And since the Car class is a child of the Automobile class, the Car class has all the properties of the parent Automobile class. Another possible child class of the Automobile class can be the Motorcycle class. Notice that Car and Motorcycle can have properties independent of each other and it's parent class, but both will share the properties of the parent class. Both have engines and both can move, but for example, you can do a wheelie on a motorcycle, but you can't with a Car, and you can't with all Automobiles. 

The example above is an example of inheritance. There are many different forms, based on the language. It is a powerful concept and can make larger code bases a lot more streamlined and clean.
